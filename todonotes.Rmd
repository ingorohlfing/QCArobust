```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### To do
**General**:  
- for AR: Get rid of plyr/purrr warning regarding compact function.

**Comparison**  
- by IR: Should be good

**Counting**  
- for AR: function searches for exact matches in list, which might be wrong. 
See examples: Result for AB is correct, result for AC is false because 
function does not detect AC in ABC.
