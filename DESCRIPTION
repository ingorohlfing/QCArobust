Description: Empirical researchers can evaluate the robustness of a 
    solution in Qualitative comparative Analysis (QCA) on three levels. 
    First, one can check whether complete solutions are identical.
    Second, one can assess robustness on the level of sufficient terms 
    (individual conditions or conjunctions) by decomposing solutions into 
    their constitutive elements. 
    Third, solutions can be decomposed into individual conditions
    (individually sufficient or INUS conditions[INUS = Insufficient and
    Necessary condition belonging to a conjunction that is Unnecessary
    and Sufficient]). \code{QCArobust} allows one to easily visualize 
    robustness of sufficient terms and individual conditions using UpSet plots.
