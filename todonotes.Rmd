### To do

**sols_plot**
- Outputs a bar chart that looks good. Needed as additional output (or separate function): Dataframe linking solution IDs from plot to actual solutions.

### In Progress Now
1. Checking the new counting against ne datasets.
2. And the **cons_minimum** check against imported solutions.


### Addressed

**Counting**  
- for AR: Done
- By AR: But needs to be checked imported datasets as the new function was introduced.

**Comparison**  
- by IR: Should be good

**config_upset**
- what does const and y option do? Is it a consistency threshold? Is this needed when we have cons_minimum function?

Correct. No noeed for the y anymore. 

**detection**

- original documentation said: "Needs further reworking to get rid of the for loop at later stages" <= is this necessary?

- JR: No, not necessary. In fact, I could not find a more efficient solution to using the loop. 
 
**cov_minimum**
- formerly dt.selector 2. Renamed it to have a meaningful function name
complemeting cons_minimum
