### To do
**Comparison**  
- by IR: Should be good

**Counting**  
- for AR: function searches for exact matches in list, which might be wrong. 
See examples: Result for AB is correct, result for AC is false because 
function does not detect AC in ABC.

**conds_upset**
- documentation says input should be dataframe, but it also works with a list
- IR: I changed documentation and example to list; df and list now options
- for AR: In example, AB is not decomposed into A and B, as it should be
