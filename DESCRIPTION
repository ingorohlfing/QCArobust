Description: The robustness of a solution in Qualitative comparative Analysis
    (QCA) can be analyzed on three levels. First, on the top level one can 
    check whether complete solutions are identical. Second, one can assess 
    robustness on the level of sufficient terms (individual conditions or 
    conjunctions) by decomposing solutions into their constitutive elements. 
    Third, solutions can be decomposed into individual conditions
    (individually sufficient or INUS conditions). The results can be easily 
    visualized using a bar chart (the first level) or Upset plots.
