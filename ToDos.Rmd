> Finished tasks

1. Replace the UpSetR chart for full solutions with a simple barchart:DONE
2. Add the selection of consistency values also for non-panel solutions: DONE

> Tasks list

1. Add the package documentation to the selector functions.
2. Add the Krogslund replication to the vignette. 
3. Add a clear differentiation between the upset_x() functions to the documentation. 
4. Edit, or create a second version, of the barplot for hand-pooled solutions (**Note to the self: for repeating functions, in general, there sould be some short cuts. Think: you repeat config, barplots, conds. Can I create an argument for the repetitions and reduce the number of functions?**)
